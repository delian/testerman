Overview
--------

This probes allows to connect to an Oracle database and perform any valid SQL command
that are valid for this DBS. Just send the SQL request as a string through a port bound
to the probe.

As a result, you should expect a ``SqlResult`` choice structure, whose ``'error'`` arm is a simple
charstring indicating an error (connection- or SQL- related), and ``result`` indicates a
successful query.

In case of a non-SELECT query, ``result`` is an empty list. In case of a SELECT query, 
it contains a list of dictionaries corresponding to the selected entries, whose keys are the
names of the returned columns. The associated values are natural Python equivalent to
SQL types. However, the following types have not been tested yet:

* ``NULL``
* blobs
* date/time

(If you encounter any problem with these SQL types or other ones, please contact us or
create a ticket).

These structures and mechanisms are common to all ``sql.*`` probe types.

The supported Oracle versions depend on the underlying Oracle libs you are using, and are
independent from the probe.

It has been tested successfully against a Oracle 10g R2 and 11g R2 servers.

Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All platforms.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This probe requires the cx_Oracle Python module, than can be found at http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net.

The cx_Oracle module is a wrapper that requires Oracle librairies.

Here is a possible path to a working probe:

* Get the Oracle Instant Client from the `Oracle site <http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/oci/instantclient/index.html>`_
  (requires free registration) for the platform that will run the probe (the Basic Lite version is sufficient)
* Decompress it wherever you want
* Under Windows, copy ``oraociicus11.dll`` and ``oci.dll`` to a directory included in the ``PYTHONPATH`` of the agent
  (in particular, you may put them into its ``plugins/probes/`` directory)
* Under Linux, copy ``?.so`` and ``oci.so`` to ``plugins/probes/`` under your agent tree, but be sure to
  add a LD_LIBRARY_PATH to this path before restarting your agent. To make the probe work from the TE (i.e. not
  hosted on a agent), you should copy them to the ``core/`` Testerman directory, since it is automatically included
  in all TE's ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.

Make sure to download Oracle Instant Client and a cx_Oracle module that are compatible with each other and
with your Oracle database version.

As far as it has been tested, using libs for Oracle 11g correctly works with a Oracle 10g server.

TTCN-3 Types Equivalence
------------------------

The test system interface port bound to such a probe complies with the ``SqlPortType`` port type as specified below:

::

  type charstring SqlRequest;

  type union Result
  {
    charstring error,
    record of SqlResult result
  }
  
  type record SqlResult
  {
    any <field name>* // according to your request 
  }
  
  type port SqlPortType message
  {
    in SqlRequest,
    out SqlResult
  }
