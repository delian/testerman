Identification and Properties
-----------------------------

Probe Type ID: ``sql.mysql``

Properties:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name","Type","Default value","Description"

   "``host``","string","``'localhost'``","The MySQL server IP address or hostname"
   "``port``","integer","``3306``","The MySQL service listening port on ``host``"
   "``db``","string","(empty)","The database to use"
   "``user``","string","(empty)","The user to use to connect to the database ``db`` above"
   "``password``","string","(empty)","The password to use, if required to connect to the database ``db`` above for user ``user``"

Overview
--------

This probes allows to connect to a MySQL database and perform any valid SQL command
that are valid for this DBS. Just send the SQL request as a string through a port bound
to the probe.

As a result, you should expect a ``SqlResult`` choice structure, whose ``'error'`` arm is a simple
charstring indicating an error (connection- or SQL- related), and ``result`` indicates a
successful query.

In case of a non-SELECT query, ``result`` is an empty list. In case of a SELECT query, 
it contains a list of dictionaries corresponding to the selected entries, whose keys are the
names of the returned columns. The associated values are natural Python equivalent to
SQL types. However, the following types have not been tested yet:

* ``NULL``
* blobs
* date/time

(If you encounter any problem with these SQL types or other ones, please contact us or
create a ticket).

These structures and mechanisms are common to all ``sql.*`` probe types.

The supported MySQL versions depend on the underlying MySQL DB libs you are using, and are
independent from the probe.

Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All platforms.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This probe requires the MySQLdb Python module.

* Debian package: ``python-mysql`` (+ dependencies)
* Windows package, egg package, sources available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python.

The Windows package also requires a MySQL ODBC connector, as available `here <http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/odbc/>`_.

TTCN-3 Types Equivalence
------------------------

The test system interface port bound to such a probe complies with the ``SqlPortType`` port type as specified below:

::

  type charstring SqlRequest;
  
  type union Result
  {
    charstring error,
    record of SqlResult result
  }
  
  type record SqlResult
  {
    any <field name>* // according to your request 
  }
  
  type port SqlPortType message
  {
    in SqlRequest,
    out SqlResult
  }
